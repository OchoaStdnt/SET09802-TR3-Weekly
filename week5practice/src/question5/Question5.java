/*
 * Write a program that simulates tossing a coin. The program should display a message to

/*
 * Modify your solution to the above question so that it tosses the coin 1000 times.
 *  Count the number of times each side of the coin appears and print the results.
 *   You shouldnâ€™t print the result of each individual toss of the coin, you only need to print 
 *   the total number of heads and the total number of tails.
